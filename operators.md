## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands.
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`
- Exponentiation: `**`
- Floor Division: `//`

Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Output: 13
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x > y)  # Output: True
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
- AND: `and`
- OR: `or`
- NOT: `not`

Example:
```python
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Output: False
```

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
- Assign: `=`
- Add and assign: `+=`
- Subtract and assign: `-=`
- Multiply and assign: `*=`
- Divide and assign: `/=`
- Modulus and assign: `%=`
- Exponentiation and assign: `**=`
- Floor division and assign: `//=`

Example:
```python
x = 10
x += 5
print(x)  # Output: 15
```

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects.
- is
- is not

Example:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
print(x is y)  # Output: False
```

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a value is present in a sequence.
- in
- not in

Example:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(2 in x)  # Output: True
```
